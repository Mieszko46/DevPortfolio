## What's it about?
This project base on popular paper/board game named *battleship*. There are two players, each player hides ships on a grid. Players take turns pressing the selected square on the other player's grid in an attempt to identify a square that contains a ship. The game board size is 10x10 and is created by squares where black square represents empty place and blue one represents ship module. If player hits opponent's ship then he can shoot one more time. The game ends when either player has shot down all of his opponent's ships.
